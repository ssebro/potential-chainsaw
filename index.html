<h1 id="engineer-yourself">Engineer Yourself</h1>
<sup>Your Best Product Should Be You.</sup>

<br>
<br>
For people who
<ul>
<li>use logic and strategy to live their best life,</li>
    <li>are tired of '7 highly effective strategies' and '10 killer hacks' that waste time & change nothing,</li>
    <li>understand the compounding power of continuously improving systems.</li>

</ul>
<strong>Welcome Home.</strong>
<br>
<br>

<p>I'm Stephen Sebro, a Stanford '09 Behavioral Economics grad, and an experienced leader in Software Engineering.</p>

<p>I believe we can combine the strategies used to design scalable software systems with those used to design behaviors, to systematically achieve <i>predictable, painless personal growth</i> that dramatically exceeds the baseline.</p>

<p>But I need your help.</p>

<p>I believe together we can figure out how to automate happiness, and change the world.</p>
