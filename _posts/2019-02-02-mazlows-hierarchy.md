Engineering Stephen started with the realization that engineering allows us to systematically, realiably solve problems.

And that happiness, or the lack thereof, is a problem. Which means that we have a shot at engineering systems that reliably solve it.

So, what if I were to apply the structured thought paterns of an engineer to life at large - to automate my happiness?

How would we do that anyways?

Well, first, we'd start with Mazlow.
