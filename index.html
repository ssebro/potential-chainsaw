<h1 id="engineer-yourself">Engineer Yourself</h1>
<sup>Your Best Product Should Be You.</sup>

<br>
<br>
For people who
<ul>
<li>use logic and strategy to live their best life,</li>
    <li>are tired of '7 highly effective strategies' and '10 killer hacks' which waste time & change nothing,</li>
    <li>understand the compounding power of continuously improving systems.</li>

</ul>
<p>I'm developing steroids for the mind: a platform for
    <i>painless, relentless self improvement.</i></p>
<br>

<p>I'm Stephen Sebro, a Stanford '09 Economics (Behavioral / Experimental) grad, and an experienced leader in Software Engineering.</p>

<p> I believe we can combine the strategies used to design scalable software systems with those used to design behaviors, to systematically achieve <i>predictable, painless personal growth</i> that dramatically exceeds the baseline.</p>

<p>But I need your help.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t have all the answers - I just have a very extensible model that we can build on, and a guinea pig (myself) who is willing to try stuff out.</p>

<p>I believe together we can work to fine tune the model and in the process change the world.</p>

<p>Join me.</p>
