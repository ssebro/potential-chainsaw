<h1 id="engineer-yourself">Engineer Yourself</h1>
<p><i>Your Best Product Should Be You.</i></p>

<br>
<p>For people that use logic and strategy to live their best life, who feel inundated by the constant stream of ‘6 strategies’ and ‘10 hacks’ that change nothing while wasting energy and time, I’m developing a system that delivers steroids for the mind: a platform for systematic, painless, relentless improvement.</p>

<p>I’m Stephen Sebro, a Stanford ‘09 Economics (Behavioral / Experimental) grad, and an experienced leader in software engineering. I believe we can combine the strategies used to design scaleable software systems with those used to design behaviors to achieve predictable, systematic personal growth that dramatically exceeds the baseline.</p>

<p>But I need your help.</p>

<p>I don’t have all the answers - I just have a very extensible model that we can build on, and a guinea pig (myself) who is willing to try stuff out.</p>

<p>I believe together we can work to fine tune the model and in the process change the world.</p>

<p>Join me.</p>
