Because **you already believe** that we can engineer systems that consistently deliver desirable outcomes in extremely complex situations.

If this were not true, you would *never*
- fly,
- purchase electronics,
- or use elevators.


You also already believe that humans can work as part of those systems that deliver those outcomes, since Boeing engineers and assemblers are humans, as are Apple engineers and their Foxxconn line-worker counterparts.

These two facts combine to create the following ethical dilimma:

If we can solve almost any problem using logical, systematic thinking, **Why aren't we using this ability to solve the most important problems of our day**?

Don't get me wrong: I really love my phone, and I respect the power it delivers to those willing and able to pay for it.

It's amazing that we can access most of the world's knowledge from a tiny portable device. As little as 30 years ago, this would have been seen as pure magic.

So why can't we for sure elect the right leaders? Zookeeper achieves this feat so often (likely thousands of times per second) that it's obscene.

Why can't we ensure that nobody dies from starvation, or from overeating?

Why can't we **build systems that ensure that people are as happy as possible**?
