You're on the right track. I love living here, and you probably will too.

They have a *sweet referral program* that will give you a *$500\* discount* that will apply to your rent.

# How To Get The $500* Vermella Harrison Referral Bonus

* It's best to lock in the referral bonus **just before you apply**, so it's on your application form.
* If you've applied but haven't signed yet, this can still work for you.
* It should take less than **5 minutes** to complete the next step and get the code emailed to you.
    * [Click here and fill out the form](http://bit.ly/Vermella-500)
    * I'll respond immediately with the info you need to provide to the leasing agent.
* Do the happy dance! You just saved $500* in 5 minutes!.


<sub>*Actual referral $$$ varies depending on time of year - I've seen the bonus rise and fall several times.</sub>
