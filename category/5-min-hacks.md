The typical cycle for product innovation is way too slow. The build/test/learn cycle in hardware takes weeks if not months, and in software, it takes from hours to months if you want statistically valid customer feedback.

But what if it could be much, much faster?

What if the build/test/learn cycle was **5 minutes**?

What you'd get would be a 5 minute hack. I approach every problem by trying to solve it first with a 5 minute hack, if no easy, obvious off-the-shelf solution exists.

These 5 minute hacks solve all sort of problems, and I hope will better illustrate the disruptive possibilities of rapid problem solving.


#### So how do you get to a 5 minute build-test-learn cycle?
<sub>_you move rapidly_</sub>
* Idea iteration under 3 minutes
* Builds under 1 minute
* Tests under 1 minute
* Learning & documentation (simultaneous with other phases)

So simple, it's obvious.
